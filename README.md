# heart-failure-detection
This repo showcases the power of data science in the healthcare field. The project uses SPSS to create a machine learning model which predicts whether a patient will get a heart failure or not. The front end of this project is a Flask app.


## SPSS flow :
This is the SPSS flow that needs to be created in order to deploy the model

## Front end application [Flask]

### Steps: 

1. Edit the predict.py file: 
2. Add your watson machine learning service credentials which you get from cloud.ibm.com
